# Algo
This is an algorithm Websight.
The websight starts by lunching a fucntion froma java script file called app.js
This websight uses Java Script, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, moments.js and Jquery

When that file is lunched, it uses HTML to give it its web look.

Users now have access to using the websight.
There are three main functionality of the websight
The tabs gives users a view of how the functionality works.

Tab one is Wilcard
Tab two is Huffman Web
Tab three is future Algorithm 
Tab four is 01 Knapsack Algorithm

Once any of the tabs is clicked, the javascript file connected to the tab is lunched.
The build of of the file is simple, it uses functions and constructors to store the properties of the wildcard algorithm.
The arguments in the constructor are created as an array so it can handle multiple data.
After the user inputs a string of characters, numbers or special symbol, the algorithm calls the Dynamic function and then processes the user inputs to give an output.

The same process is used for every other tab in the website.
Enjoy the website.
